# GTD (Getting Things Done) Core Components

## 1. Capture
Get everything out of your head into a trusted system (inbox)

## 2. Clarify
Process each item:
- Is it actionable?
- If no → trash, someday/maybe, or reference
- If yes → what's the next action?

## 3. Organize
Put items where they belong:
- **Next Actions** - single tasks you can do now (often by context: @home, @office, @calls)
- **Projects** - anything requiring 2+ actions to complete
- **Waiting For** - delegated items you're tracking
- **Calendar** - date/time specific commitments only
- **Someday/Maybe** - things you might do later
- **Reference** - non-actionable info you might need

## 4. Reflect
Regular reviews:
- **Daily** - check calendar and next actions
- **Weekly Review** - process inbox, review all lists, update projects

## 5. Engage
Choose what to do based on:
- Context (where you are, tools available)
- Time available
- Energy level
- Priority

## Key Principles
- Next action must be a physical, visible action (not "plan project" but "draft outline for project")
- Projects need a defined outcome and at least one next action
- Two-minute rule: if it takes <2 min, do it now
- Mind like water: trusted system = clear head

# Horizons of Focus (Altitudes)

## Ground Level - Current Actions
Next actions, calendar items, calls, emails

## 10,000 ft - Projects
Outcomes requiring multiple actions (1 week to 1 year)

## 20,000 ft - Areas of Focus & Responsibility
Roles you maintain: health, finance, career, family, home, spiritual
Ongoing standards and accountabilities

## 30,000 ft - Goals & Objectives
1-2 year targets
What you want to accomplish in each area

## 40,000 ft - Vision
3-5 year picture
Long-term career, lifestyle, organization direction

## 50,000 ft - Purpose & Principles
Why you exist / why the organization exists
Core values that guide decisions

**The idea:** Higher altitudes inform lower ones. Your purpose shapes your vision, vision shapes goals, goals shapes areas of focus, areas generate projects, projects generate actions.

Weekly reviews focus on ground through 20,000 ft. Higher altitudes get reviewed less frequently (monthly, quarterly, annually).
